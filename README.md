# Operating Systems

## Overview
This repository documents the practical work and assignments completed during my Operating Systems and its Laboratory course at the university. It serves as an archive for my hands-on implementations and exercises that delve into various core concepts of operating systems.

## Features
- **CPU Scheduling**: Implementations of CPU scheduling algorithms including Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority scheduling, and First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).
- **Deadlock Handling**: Examples and solutions to famous deadlock scenarios, showcasing prevention and avoidance strategies.
- **Synchronization**: Practical exercises on synchronization mechanisms like mutexes and semaphores to manage concurrent processes.
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: Demonstrations of IPC techniques, allowing processes to communicate and synchronize their actions.
- **Threads & Processes**: Exploration of multi-threading and process management, emphasizing the creation, execution, and coordination of threads and processes.
